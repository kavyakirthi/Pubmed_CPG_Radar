# What is PubMed?
PubMed is a free online database that is created and curated by the U.S National Library of Medicine. 
Publicly accessible to everyone; PubMed provides access to millions of references and abstracts from the biomedical and life sciences literature. 
Researchers, clinicians and students access PubMed to locate scientific publications, keep track of advances in medicine, and review the literature. 

# What does the pymed Python library do?
The pymed library provides a Python wrapper around PubMed API, i.e., Entrez. 
The pymed library essentially allows you to search PubMed programmatically, return article metadata (title, authors, abstract, journal) and manage that data in your scripts. 
The pymed library makes using PubMed for biomedical literature mining easier by avoiding the manual process of downloading each record. 

PubMed is a comprehensive online resource for accessing biomedical and life sciences literature. 
It allows users to search through millions of articles and find literature that covers everything related to medicine, health, biology, and beyond. 
The pymed Python library delivers a pattern to query PubMed programmatically, retrieve structured article-data and to analyze or summarize their publications within the context of your Python workflow. 
PubMed and pymed can be used together to easily curate scientific evidence and create custom tools to do biomedical literature mining and research synthesis.
